# Write a program that takes in an integer in the range 20-98 as input. The output is a countdown starting from the integer, and stopping when both output digits are identical.

# Ex: If the input is:
# 93

# the output is:
# 93 92 91 90 89 88

# Ex: If the input is:
# 77

# the output is:
# 77

# Ex: If the input is:
# 15
# or any value not between 20 and 98 (inclusive)

# the output is:
# Input must be 20-98

# Use a while loop. Compare the digits; do not write a large if-else for all possible same-digit numbers (11, 22, 33, â€¦, 88), as that approach would be cumbersome for larger ranges.
