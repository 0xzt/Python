# (2) Below the tree (with two blank lines), output this cat. (Submit for 3 points, so 5 points total).

# /\   /\

#  =   =

# Hint: A backslash \ in a string acts as an escape character, such as with a newline \n. So, to print an actual backslash, escape that backslash by prepending another backslash. Ex: The following prints a single backslash: print('\\')
